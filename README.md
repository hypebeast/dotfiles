My personal dotfiles managed with [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

Supports `macOS` and `Ubuntu/Debian`.

## Features

- oh-my-zsh for zsh config.
- spf13-vim for vim config.
- Every config file/folder gets linked to its place in the system. No copy of files.
- Clear structure of config files: every application has its their own folder.
- Every config file is linked with stow. No other tool is used.
- Bootstrap script to setup a dev machine with all required packages and tools.
- Scripts to install required packages with _brew_ and _cask_.
- Support for macOS and Linux (Ubuntu).
- No dependencies, except Bash and gnu stow.

## 🚀 Installation

Execute the [`installer`](installer) from your terminal in order to avoid even having to manually install git!

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypebeast/dotfiles/master/installer)
```

## Setup (⚠️ Outdated documentation ⚠️)

First, make sure you have _stow_ installed. Then, clone this repository to `~/dotfiles`.

### Bootstrap your Development Machine

Bootstrap the dotfiles with

```
$ make bootstrap
```

### Link the dotfiles

Link all dotfiles with

```
$ make link
```

If you want to link individual config files you can use stow directly. For example,

```
$ stow git
```

This will link all git config files to your home directory.

List all available commands with:

```
$ make help
```
